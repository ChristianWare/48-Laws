## Keys To Power

No one enjoys feeling stupid. Consequently, a great trick is to make your opponents feel smarter than you. Once they believe themselves to be more intelligent, they will never suspect that you have any ulterior motives.

## Authority

Know how to make use of stupidity: The wisest man plays this card at times. There are occasions when the highest wisdom consists in appearing not to know-you must not be ignorant but capable of playing it. It is not much good being wise among fools and sane among lunatics. He who poses as a fool is not a fooI. The best way to be weIl received by all is to clothe yourself in the skin of the dumbest of brutes. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658)

## Reversal

To reveal the true nature of yoUf intelligence rarely pays; you should get in the habit of downplaying it at all times. If people inadvertently learn the truth-that you are actually much smarter than you look-they will admire you more for being discreet than for making YOUf brilliance show. At the start of your climb to the top, of course, you cannot play too stupid: You may want to let YOUf bosses know, in a subtle way, that you are smarter than the competition around you. As you climb the ladder, however, you should to some degree try to dampen YOUf brilliance.

There is, however, one situation where it pays to do the opposite-­ when you can cover up a deception with a show of intelligence. In matters of smarts as in most things, appearances are what count. If you seem to have authority and knowledge, people will believe what you say. This can be very useful in getting you out of a scrape.
