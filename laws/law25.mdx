description: "Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define it for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions-your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life."

## Keys To Power

Do not accept the role that society has given you. Forge your own identity, one that commands attention. Master your image rather than letting others dictate it for you. Remake yourself into a figure of power as if molding yourself from clay. 

To do this, you must first be self-aware, and you must learn to master your emotions. Then, you must create a memorable character. From here, you can learn to play many roles to adapt to what any given situation requires of you. However, remember that overacting can be counterproductive.

## Authority

Know how to be all things to all men. A discreet Proteus-a scholar among scholars, a saint among saints. That is the art of winning over everyone, far like attracts like. Take note of temperaments and adapt yourself to that of each person you meet-follow the lead of the serious and jovial in turn, changing your mood discreetly. (Baltasar Craci√§n, 1601-1658)

## Reversal

There can really be no reversal to this critical law: Bad theater is bad theater. Even appearing natural requires art-in other words, acting. Bad acting only creates embarrassment. Of course you should not be too dramatic-avoid the histrionic gesture. But that is simply bad theater anyway, since it violates centuries-old dramatic laws against overacting. In essence there is no reversal to this law.
