title: "Make Your Accomplishments Seem Effortless"
description: "Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as iJ you could do much more. Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you work-it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you."

## Keys To Power

Always plan until the end. This means thinking through every possibility that could prevent you from reaching your end goal. Thus, you will be able to accommodate for any surprises along the way and secure your future.

Most people are too trapped by their emotions in the moment to see ahead, so this will give you the upper hand. Plan in detail before you act, and donâ€™t succumb to making any vague plans. Your end goal must always be crystal clear.

## Authority

For whatever action [nonchalance] accompanies, no matter how trivial it is, it not only reveals the skill of the person doing it but also very often causes it to be considered far greater than it really iso This is because it makes the onlookers believe that a man who performs weIl with so much facility must possess even greater skill than he does. (Baldassare Castiglione, 1478- 1529)

## Reversal

The secrecy with which you surround YOUf actions must seem lighthearted in spirit. A zeal to conceal YOUf work creates an unpleasant, almost paranoiac impression: you are taking the game too seriously. Houdini was careful to make the concealment of his tricks seem a game, all part of the show. Never show YOUf work until it is finished, but if you put too much effort into keeping it under wraps you will be like the painter Pontormo, who spent the last years of his life hiding his frescoes from the public eye and only succeeded in driving hirnself mad. Always keep your sense of humor about yourself.
