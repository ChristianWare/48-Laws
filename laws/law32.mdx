description: "The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes from disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses."

## Keys To Power

As the truth is often ugly, if you appeal to it, you risk being bombarded with the anger of disenchantment. Instead, by tapping into the fantasies of the masses, people will flock to you as you offer an alternative to the disillusionment of reality. By observing which aspects of everyday life are most abhorred, you can conjure up fantasies that promise the opposite of peoples’ current realities and thus wield a phenomenal power.

## Authority

A lie is an allurement, a fabrication, that can be embellished into a fantasy. It can be clothed in the raiments of a mystic conception. Truth is cold, sober fact, not so comfortable to absorb. A lie is more palatable. The most detested person in the world is the one who always teIls the truth, who never romances. . . . I found it far more interesting and profitable to romance than to tell the truth. (Joseph Weil, a.k.a. "The Yellow Kid," 1875-1976)

## Reversal

If there is power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses, there is also danger. Fantasy usually contains an element of play-the public half realizes it is being duped, but it keeps the dream alive anyway, relishing the entertainment and the temporary diversion from the everyday that you are providing. So keep it light-never come too close to the place where you are actually expected to produce results. That place may prove extremely hazardous.

One last thing: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy is always fantastical. It certainly contrasts with reality, but reality itself is sometimes so theatrical and stylized that fantasy be comes a desire for simple things. The image Abraham Lincoln created of hirnself, for example, as a homespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the common man's president.
