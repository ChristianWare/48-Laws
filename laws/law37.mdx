title: "Create Compelling Spectacles"
description: "Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of power-everyone responds to them. Stage spectacles for those around you, then, Juli of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence. Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing."

## Keys To Power

By generating grand, spectacular gestures, you will heighten your presence and your power. People will be too dazzled by appearances to uncover what youâ€™re really up to. As opposed to using words, visual gestures contain an emotive power and immediacy that leave no room for doubt. Where words divide, images unite. Use this to your advantage.

## Authority

The people are always impressed by the superficial appearance of things .... The prince should, at fitting times of the year, keep the people occupied and distracted with festivities and spectacl es. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469- 1527)

## Reversal

No power is made available by ignoring images and symbols. There is no possible reversal to this law.
