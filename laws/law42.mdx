title: "Strike the Shepherd, and the Sheep Will Scatter"
description: "Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual-the stirrer; the arrogant underling, the poisoner oJ goodwill. If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them-they are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source oJ the trouble and the sheep will scatter."

## Keys To Power

All trouble can usually be traced back to one individual. By rooting out this individual and preventing them from operating, you will stop their influence. Donâ€™t waste time, or their influence will multiply. In every group, power is concentrated around one or two people. Consequently, understanding who controls the group is critical. This is made more challenging, as troublemakers prefer to disguise their actions. Isolate their power, however, and they become redundant.

## Authority

If you draw a bow, draw the strongest. If you use an arrow, use the longest. To shoot a rider, first shoot his horse. To catch a gang of bandits, first capture its leader. Just as a count ry has its border, so the killing of men has its limits. If the enemy's attack can be stopped [with a blow to the headJ, why have any more dead and wounded than necessary? (Chinese poet Tu Fu, Tang dynasty, eighth century)

## Reversal

"Any harm you do to a man should be done in such a way that you need not fear his revenge," writes Machiavelli. If you act to isolate your enemy, make sure he lacks the means to repay the favor. If you apply this Law, in other words, apply it from a position of superiority, so that you have nothing to fear from his resentment.

Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln's successor as V.S. president, saw Ulysses S. Grant as a troublesome member of his government. So he isolated Grant, as a prelude to forcing him out. This only enraged the great general, however, who responded by forming a support base in the Republican party and going on to become the next president. It would have been far wiser to keep a man like Grant in the fold, where he could do less harm, than to make him revengeful. And so you may often find it better to keep people on your side, where you can watch them, than to risk creating an angry enemy. Keeping them dose, you can secretly whittle away at their support base, so that when the time comes to cut them loose they will fall fast and hard without knowing what hit them.
