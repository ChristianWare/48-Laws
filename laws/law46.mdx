title: "Never Appear Too Perfect"
description: "Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display deJects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity."

## Keys To Power

While appearing superior to others is dangerous, to appear faultless and without weakness is even more perilous. By displaying harmless vices, you prevent envy from developing, and you make yourself appear more approachable. By letting envy fester, it can manifest in a host of problematic ways that will ultimately try to rob you of your power. Stop it in its tracks by making yourself seem powerful but not faultless.

## Authority

Upon occasion, reveal a harmless defect in YOUf character. For the envious accuse the most perfect of sinning by having no sins. They become an Argus, all eyes for finding fault with excellence-it is their only consolation. Do not let envy burst with its own venom-affect some lapse in valor or intellect, so as to dis arm it beforehand. You thus wave YOUf red cape before the Horns of Envy, in order to save YOUf immortality. (Baltasar Graci√§n, 1601-1658)

## Reversal

The reason for being careful with the envious is that they are so indirect, and will find innumerable ways to undermine you. But treading carefully around them will often only make their envy worse. They sense that you are being cautious, and it registers as yet another sign of YOUf superiority. That is why you must act before envy takes root.

Once envy is there, however, whether through YOUf fault or not, it is sometimes best to affect the opposite approach: Display the utmost disdain for those who envy you. Instead of hiding YOUf perfection, make it obvious. Make every new triumph an opportunity to make the envious squirm. YOUf good fortune and power become their living hell. If you .attain a position of unimpeachable power, their envy will have no effect on you, and you will have the best revenge of all: They are trapped in envy while you are free in YOUf power.

This is how Michelangelo triumphed over the venomous architect Bramante, who turned Pope Julius against Michelangelo's design for his tomb. Bramante envied Michelangelo's godlike skills, and to this one triumph-the aborted tomb project-he thought to add another, by pushing the pope to commission Michelangelo to paint the murals in the Sistine Chapel. The project would take years, during which Michelangelo would accomplish no more of his brilliant sculptures. Furthermore, Bramante considered Michelangelo not nearly as skilled in painting as in sculpture. The chapel would spoil his image as the perfect artist.

Michelangelo saw the trap and wanted to turn down the commission, but he could not refuse the pope, so he accepted it without complaint. Then, however, he used Bramante's envy to spur him to greater heights, making the Sistine Chapel his most perfect work of all. Every time Bramante heard of it or saw it, he felt more oppressed by his own envy-the sweetest and most lasting revenge you can exact on the envious.
