title: "Win Through Your Actions, Never Through Argument"
description: "Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate."

## Keys To Power

Any triumph you gain through argument will be short lived. Resentment will fester in your opponents instead of a genuine change of opinion. Instead, let your actions speak for you. If people agree with you through your actions instead of your words, you are more likely to sway lasting opinions. Words are a dime a dozen, and people will say anything to prove a point. Action is where you demonstrate your beliefs.

## Authority

Never argue. In society nothing must be discussed; give only results, (Benjamin Disraeli, 1804-1881)

## Reversal

Verbal argument has one vital use in the realm of power: To distract and cover your tracks when you are practicing deception or are caught in a He. In such cases it is to your advantage to argue with all the conviction you can muster. Draw the other person into an argument to distract them from your deceptive move. When caught in a He, the more emotional and certain you appear, the less likley it seems that you are lying.
